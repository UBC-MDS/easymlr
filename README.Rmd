easymlr is an open-source library designed to perform exploratory data analysis, to help with missing data imputation and to give baseline models. Also, it assists in feature selection which is a common problem when undertaking a data science or machine learning analysis. As it's name indicates, this function performs all task from eda to helping in choosing model for machine learning process very easily.

## Installation

You can install the released version of easymlr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("easymlr")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/easymlr")
```
## Features

This package introduces a data science enthusiast, with little to no knowledge of machine learning, to the common steps required when undertaking a Supervised learning analysis. The package contains four functions that accept a pandas DataFrame. All functions can be used on a dataset with numerical features. The functions might have their own required and optional arguments.

- **eda**: The `eda` function will split the original data into train and test dataset and will generate a statistical report such as correlation between the variables, number of missing data, class imbalance and type of data present in the dataset.

- **miss_data**: The `miss_data` function will handle missing numerical data in the data frame.

- **baseline_fun**: The `baseline_fun` function will give users a quick check of the performance of the selected sklearn models compared to a baseline model, upon which the model can be improved. 

- **feature_select**: The `feature_select` function will remove redundant features based on the forward selection.


## Relevance to the R Ecosystem

There is no general-purpose library for performing the above task in the R ecosystem.

## Dependencies

-  R version 4.0.3

## Usage


| Task | Function  |
|------------|-----|
| Exploratory data analysis| `eda_analysis(df)`|
| Numerical data imputation| `miss_data(x_train, x_test, strategy="mean")`|
| Compare selected model to a baseline model| `baseline_fun(X_train, y_train, type="regression", metrics_1="accuracy", metrics_2="r2")`|
| Feature selection to reduce data dimension| `feature_select(X_train, y_train, threshold=0.05)`|


## Example 

[here]()

``` R
library(easymlr)

df <- data.frame('x' = c(400, NA, 300, NA), 'y' = c(24, NA, 30, 560))

- eda <- eda_analysis(df)
- imputed_data <- miss_data(x_train, x_test, strategy="mean")
- results <- baseline_fun(X, y, type = 'regression')
- best_features <- feature_select(X_train, y_train, threshold=0.05)


```
